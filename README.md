# Documentation
Hello!

Thank you for your interest and for taking the time to review my technical writing skills.

Welcome to my page. This is where i have hosted all the Technical Writing work samples!

My writing samples include a process document, a quickstart guide, and a how-to guide. 
I'm also currently working on creating a technical writing work porfolito and a frequently asked questions (FAQs) page, and I plan to add them here once I finish. 
Moreover, I believe in continuous improvement, so Iâ€™ll constantly update my samples as I see fit.

Thank you!
