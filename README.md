Hello!

Thank you for your interest and for taking the time to review my technical writing skills.

Welcome to my page. This is where i have hosted all the Technical Writing work samples!

My writing samples include:
Quickstart Guide, a How-to-Guide, API guide, and Getting Started. 

I have created the Quickstart Guide in Markdown to showcase my knowledge on this tool.
The other guides are in pdf format as they are the work samples that i had worked in my current and past organization in different tools such as oxygen XML and MadcapFlare.

I'm also currently working on creating a technical writing work porfolito and a frequently asked questions (FAQs) page, and I plan to add them here once I finish. 
Moreover, I believe in continuous improvement, so Iâ€™ll constantly update my samples as I see fit.

Thank you!
Sweta Kumari
